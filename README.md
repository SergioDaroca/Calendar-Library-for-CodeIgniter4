# Calendar-Library-for-CodeIgniter4
Adaptation of the fantastic original Calendar Library as in codeigniter 1.7.2, for PHP 8.*, tested with love on codeigniter 4.6

I have tested it and it works as the original did.

If somebody has the time to review, test, document, so it could be included in the framework, or set out as a module, it would be awesome.

This library was one of the main reasons I got to use CodeIgniter the first time. It is so easy and powerful.
